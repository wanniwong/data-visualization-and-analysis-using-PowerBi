# Data Visualization and Analysis with PowerBI

The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on every corner of life is deleterious. To control the pandemic, scientists around the world have worked together to research and develop vaccines. However, there are people concerning about the risks of vaccination especially when blood clotting has been reported as one of the rare serious side effects. Therefore, this project aims to generate a dashboard that analyzes the trends on adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine. A dashboard can help professionals to monitor adverse events, detect new and rare reactions, as well as identify potential risk factors for certain types of symptoms. Meanwhile, for public, it can help improve public confidence of vaccine and eventually increase the vaccine registration rate.

PowerBI is extensively used throughout four phases of the project:

(1) Data ingestion - Datasets are obtained from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html, and Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_abbreviations

(2) ETL - Power Query Editor for data cleaning, handling of missing data, and feature engineering

(3) Dashboard development - PowerBI to gain insights from datasets (Please refer [**dashboard.pdf**](dashboard.pdf))

(4) Analysis - PowerBI analytics tools such as forecasting, average, etc.
