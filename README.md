# Data Visualization and Analysis with PowerBI

The impact of COVID-19 outbreak on every corner of life is deleterious. To control the pandemic, scientists around the world have worked together to research and develop vaccines. People are concerning about the risks of vaccination especially when blood clotting has been reported as one of the rare serious side effects from the vaccine. Therefore, this project aims to generate a dashboard that analyzes the current trend in adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccine. A dashboard can help professionals to monitor adverse events, detect new and rare reactions, as well as identify potential risk factors for certain types of symptoms. Meanwhile, for public, it is believed that a dashboard which provides a clear trend on vaccine adverse events can improve public confidence of vaccine and eventually increase the vaccine registration rate.

PowerBI is extensively used throughout the four phases of project.

(1) Data ingestion - Datasets are obtained from Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html, and Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_abbreviations

(2) ETL - Power Query Editor is used for data cleaning, handling of missing data, and feature engineering

(3) Dashboard development - PowerBI to gain insights from datasets (Please refer [**dashboard.pdf**](PowerBI-Dashboard.pdf))

(4) Analysis - PowerBI analytics tools such as forecasting, average, etc.
